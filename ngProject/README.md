# Quiz Application

### Setup

- run this application via some tool like WebStorm / Visual Studio. And run 'bower i' to install packages
- Open the index.html in WebStorm --> click browser icon on the upper right OR in Visual Studio and then right click -> View in Browser. 


- I used WebdriverIO in my last project as the test tool, since it will take some time to set up all the environment that needed. So I just write the test code in the test folder. It's nor runnable. But it will pass after all the set up is done.
